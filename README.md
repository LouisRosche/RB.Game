# RB.Game

A solo developer's 18-month roadmap to building a profitable, ethical indie game business — starting with Roblox for rapid validation, then expanding to Godot for full IP ownership.

## Goals

1. **Phase 0 — Foundation** (Weeks 1-6): Business setup, learn Roblox Studio, validate a game concept
2. **Phase 1 — Roblox MVP** (Weeks 7-20): Ship a free tycoon/simulator, hit D1 retention >= 20%
3. **Phase 2 — Monetization & Growth** (Weeks 21-40): Ethical cosmetics + game passes, reach $500+/month revenue
4. **Phase 3 — Portfolio Expansion** (Weeks 41-78): Build a standalone Godot game, launch on Steam with 7K+ wishlists

## Key Principles

- **Ship small, ship fast** — 60-80 hour MVPs, not multi-year passion projects
- **Ethical monetization** — Cosmetics and convenience passes, no loot boxes or pay-to-win
- **Systems over content** — Procedural generation and modular assets beat the content treadmill
- **Dual-platform strategy** — Roblox for validation + revenue, Godot for IP ownership
- **Portfolio staircase** — Each shipped game compounds skills and audience (2nd games sell 40% better)
